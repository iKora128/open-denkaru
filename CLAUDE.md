## Quality Assurance and Testing Standards

### Mandatory Testing Protocol
**CRITICAL**: All development work MUST follow this testing protocol before deployment:

1. **Build Verification (Required)**
   ```bash
   # Frontend build verification
   npm run build
   # Must complete successfully with no TypeScript errors
   
   # Backend build verification
   uv run pytest
   # All tests must pass
   ```

2. **Code Quality Checks (Required)**
   ```bash
   # Frontend linting
   npm run lint
   # Must have zero errors, warnings acceptable
   
   # Type checking
   npm run type-check
   # Must pass with no type errors
   
   # Backend linting
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run mypy .
   # Must pass all checks
   ```

3. **Performance Testing (Required)**
   - Frontend pages must load in < 2 seconds
   - API responses must be < 500ms for standard queries
   - Database queries must be optimized (< 100ms for patient lookups)

4. **Security Validation (Required)**
   - All API endpoints must have proper authentication
   - Input validation on all forms
   - SQL injection prevention verified
   - XSS protection validated

### Development Workflow Requirements

**Before ANY commit or pull request:**

1. **Local Testing Suite**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   npm run build && npm run lint && npm run type-check
   uv run pytest && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy .
   ```

2. **Manual Verification**
   - Start development server and verify core functionality
   - Test at least 3 critical user flows (patient registration, medical record entry, prescription)
   - Verify responsive design on mobile and desktop
   - Check console for JavaScript errors

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
   - Patient search response: < 500ms
   - Form submission feedback: < 300ms

### Zero-Tolerance Standards

**The following issues will cause immediate rejection:**

1. **Build Failures**: Code that doesn't compile/build successfully
2. **Type Errors**: Any TypeScript compilation errors
3. **Critical Security Flaws**: Unvalidated inputs, exposed secrets, SQL injection risks
4. **Performance Regressions**: Pages loading > 3 seconds, API responses > 1 second
5. **Medical Data Integrity**: Any code that could corrupt patient records

### Testing Philosophy for Medical Systems

**Medical-Grade Reliability**:
- **99.9% Uptime Target**: System must be reliable for 24/7 healthcare operations
- **Data Integrity**: Zero tolerance for data corruption or loss
- **User Safety**: UI must prevent medical errors through validation and confirmation
- **Audit Compliance**: All actions must be logged and traceable
- **Performance Under Load**: System must handle 100+ concurrent users

**Testing Pyramid for Healthcare**:
1. **Unit Tests (70%)**: Every function that handles medical data
2. **Integration Tests (20%)**: API endpoints and database interactions  
3. **E2E Tests (10%)**: Critical clinical workflows
4. **Manual Testing**: Usability and clinical workflow validation

### Deployment Readiness Checklist

**Before any production deployment:**

- [ ] All automated tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan completed (no critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Medical workflow validation by clinical team
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] HIPAA compliance audit completed (for patient data)
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, user guides)

### Medical Emergency Protocol

**For critical production issues:**

1. **Immediate Response** (< 5 minutes)
   - Take affected systems offline if patient safety at risk
   - Notify medical staff of system status
   - Activate backup procedures

2. **Investigation and Fix** (< 30 minutes)
   - Identify root cause
   - Implement emergency patch
   - Test fix in staging environment

3. **Recovery and Post-Mortem** (< 2 hours)
   - Deploy verified fix to production
   - Verify all systems operational
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update procedures to prevent recurrence

**Remember**: In medical systems, software reliability directly impacts patient care and safety.

## Development Principles for Long-Term Viability

### Medical-Grade Development Strategy
- **Stability First**: Proven technologies over cutting-edge for mission-critical features
- **Battle-Tested Libraries**: Choose libraries with extensive production healthcare usage
- **Modular Architecture**: Enable component replacement without system rewrites
- **API-First Design**: Decouple frontend and backend for technology flexibility
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Medical-grade reliability requires extensive test coverage

### Technology Selection Criteria
1. **Production Proven**: Must have extensive real-world medical system usage
2. **Stability**: Mature APIs with predictable upgrade paths
3. **Ecosystem**: Rich library ecosystem for rapid development
4. **Medical Compliance**: Built-in support for HIPAA, accessibility, audit trails
5. **Performance**: Sub-2-second response times for critical workflows
6. **Community**: Strong long-term community and enterprise support

### Version Management Protocol
- **Stable-First**: Use stable LTS versions for production deployments
- **Research Before Upgrade**: Thoroughly evaluate new versions before adoption
- **Security Priority**: Immediate security updates, planned feature updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility during technology evolution
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation of all technology decisions and rationales

### Medical System Technology Monitoring
- **Security-Focused Reviews**: Immediate evaluation of security patches and updates
- **Quarterly Stability Assessment**: Review system performance and stability metrics
- **Annual Technology Roadmap**: Conservative planning for major upgrades
- **Medical Community Engagement**: Participate in healthcare IT and regulatory discussions
- **Conservative Upgrade Approach**: Minimum 6-month evaluation period for major technology changes

### Code Quality and Error Checking Protocol

**MANDATORY: Always run linting and type-checking before any commit or deployment**

#### Frontend Quality Checks (Required)
```bash
# Type checking - MUST pass with zero errors
npm run type-check

# Linting - MUST pass with zero errors (warnings acceptable)
npm run lint

# Build verification - MUST complete successfully
npm run build
```

#### Development Workflow Standards
1. **Before Every Commit**: Run all quality checks
2. **Before Every Pull Request**: Ensure clean build and type-check
3. **Error Tolerance**: Zero TypeScript errors, ESLint warnings acceptable for unused type definitions
4. **Medical Safety**: Any error that could affect patient data or medical workflows must be fixed immediately

#### Common Error Patterns to Fix
- **Unused imports**: Remove all unused imports to keep code clean
- **Type safety**: Fix all TypeScript errors, especially optional chaining issues
- **Missing type annotations**: Add proper type annotations for function parameters and return values
- **Incorrect type usage**: Use `typeof EnumName[keyof typeof EnumName]` for enum value types

#### When to Use Quality Checks
- **During active development**: Check frequently while coding
- **Before breaks**: Always run checks before stepping away from code
- **After major changes**: Full quality check after significant refactoring
- **Pre-deployment**: Complete verification before any production deployment

**Remember**: In medical systems, code quality directly impacts patient safety. Never skip quality checks.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Traditional approach (replaced)
class Patient(Base):          # SQLAlchemy model
class PatientCreate(BaseModel):  # Pydantic schema
class PatientResponse(BaseModel): # Another schema

# SQLModel approach (current)
class PatientBase(SQLModel):     # Shared base
class Patient(PatientBase, table=True):  # Database model
class PatientCreate(PatientBase):        # Input schema
class PatientResponse(PatientBase):      # Output schema
```
