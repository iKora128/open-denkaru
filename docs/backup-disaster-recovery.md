## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Backup Failures

**Symptom**: Backup job fails with timeout
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /var/backups/medical_emr

# Check database connectivity
psql -h postgres-primary -U postgres -c "SELECT 1;"

# Review backup logs
tail -f /var/log/medical_emr/backup.log

# Manual backup with verbose output
./scripts/backup-automation.sh full --verbose
```

**Symptom**: Backup file corruption detected
```bash
# Verify checksum
sha256sum /path/to/backup/file

# Test backup file integrity
pg_restore --list /path/to/backup/file

# Re-run backup with verification
./scripts/backup-automation.sh full --verify
```

#### Replication Issues

**Symptom**: High replication lag
```bash
# Check replication status
psql -h postgres-primary -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"

# Check WAL shipping
ls -la /var/backups/medical_emr/wal/

# Monitor network connectivity
ping postgres-replica-01
```

**Symptom**: Replica disconnection
```bash
# Check replica logs
docker logs medical-emr-replica-01

# Restart replication
